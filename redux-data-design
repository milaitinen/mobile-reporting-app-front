REDUX: GENERAL INFO
(https://redux.js.org/)

--> an open-source JavaScript library designed for managing application state.
--> the state of the whole application is stored in an object tree within a single store.

WHY REDUX?

--> helps to manage complex and ever-changing UI state
--> 3 principles: single source of truth, state is read-only, changes are made with pure functions
--> no need to go through the daunting task of keeping track of states in every component when one component has been updated
--> easy testing

--> consists of: actions, reducers, and a store.

actions-----------------------------------------------

- sends data from the application to the store
- ONLY source of information for the store
- plain JS (action) object with the property 'type' and arbitrary number of other properties that is optional
- usually sent through Action Creators, that are functions, which, as the name suggests, creates actions.

    e.g. "insertUsername" action creator that creates an action object with type 'INSERT_USERNAME'

        export const insertUsername = (address) => ({
            type: 'INSERT_USERNAME',
            email: address
        });

reducers----------------------------------------------

- specify how the application state changes in response to actions sent to the store
- actions ONLY describe the fact that something happened. Reducers instead are the ones that handle the state changes

    e.g. const initialState = {
             email: null,
             password: null
         };

        const userReducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
             switch (action.type) {
                 case 'INSERT_USERNAME':
                     return {
                         ...state,
                         email: action.email
                     };
                 default:
                     return state;
             }
         };

store-------------------------------------------------

- the object that brings actions and reducers together
- only one store per application. Multiple reducers are used in case you want to split data handling logic

DATA FLOW---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(https://redux.js.org/docs/basics/DataFlow.html)

4 steps:
    1. an action is called ( store.dispatch(action) )
    2. the store passes two arguments to the reducer: the current state tree and the action
    3. the root reducer possibly combines the output of multiple reducers into a single tree (combineReducers())
    4. the store saves the complete state tree returned by the root reducer

DATA DESIGN FOR OUR APPLICATION (how application information is stored in the store)

As not all states need Redux to be kept track of (e.g. isLoading when a page loads), only the most important core data
are stored in the store - or - that's how it should be...
